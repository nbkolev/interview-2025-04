# Description
As specification forbids the use of conditional statements, branching instructions and loops the program contains the following workarounds:
* Loop from 1 to 100 is replaced with tail recursion.
* Conditional statements and branch instructions are replaced with implicit exhaustive table containing lambda functions.

# Requirements
* Python (any decent version)
